Hey, I'm Youcef.

Staff software engineer. I build and scale distributed systems.

Writing about tech, AI, and building things — both at work and for fun.

On the job: agentic AI in production, MCP servers, AI-assisted coding. What ships, what breaks, what I learned.

Off the clock: side projects, experiments, and trying interesting ideas until something clicks.
