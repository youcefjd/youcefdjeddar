description: "First post of my AI journal - why I'm documenting this journey and what to expect."
---

This is the beginning of my AI journal. I've decided to document my learning, experiments, and thoughts as I dive deeper into the world of artificial intelligence.

## Why this blog?

Writing helps me think. By documenting what I learn, I hope to:

- Solidify my understanding of complex concepts
- Track my progress over time
- Share useful insights with others on a similar path
- Build a reference I can return to

## What to expect

I'll be writing about:

- Machine learning fundamentals and intuitions
- Hands-on experiments with models and datasets
- Thoughts on papers and research
- Tool reviews and workflow improvements
- Project walkthroughs

The posts will be practical and honest. When something doesn't work, I'll write about that too.

Let's see where this goes.
