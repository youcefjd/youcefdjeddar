This is the beginning of my AI journal. I'm documenting what I learn as I build with AI in production — not toy apps, but real systems.

## Why this blog?

Writing helps me think. By documenting what I learn, I hope to:

- Solidify my understanding of complex systems
- Track my progress over time
- Share practical insights with others on a similar path
- Build a reference I can return to

## What to expect

I'll be writing about:

- **Agentic AI** — building autonomous systems that reason, plan, and act
- **MCP servers** — the Model Context Protocol and real-world integrations
- **AI-assisted coding** — using tools like Claude Code and Copilot as serious development tools in production workflows
- **What actually works** — honest takes on the hype vs. reality

The posts will be practical. When something doesn't work, I'll write about that too.

Let's see where this goes.
