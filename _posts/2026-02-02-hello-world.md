description: "Documenting what actually works with agentic AI in production."
---

We're in a new era. Agentic AI is changing how software gets built and shipped. I've been using these tools in production and want to document what I'm learning.

Not tutorials for beginners. Not hype. Just notes from the field.

## What I'll cover

- **Agentic AI in practice** — autonomous systems that reason, plan, and execute real tasks
- **MCP servers** — building integrations with the Model Context Protocol
- **AI-assisted coding** — using Claude Code, Copilot, and similar tools as core parts of production workflows
- **What actually ships** — separating signal from noise

The posts will be practical and honest. When something doesn't work, I'll write about that too.
