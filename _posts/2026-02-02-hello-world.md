description: "Documenting what actually works with agentic AI in production."
---

We're in a new era. Agentic AI is changing how software gets built and shipped. I've been using these tools in production and want to document what I'm learning.

Here's the thing: using AI to build a weekend project is nothing like running it in production. Everyone's seen the demos — spin up a todo app in 5 minutes, mass produce vibe coded prototypes that mass produce bugs. Cool. Now try shipping that to real users, maintaining it, debugging it at 2am when something breaks. Completely different game.

Not tutorials for beginners. Not hype. Just notes from the field.

## What I'll cover

- **Agentic AI in practice** — autonomous systems that reason, plan, and execute real tasks
- **MCP servers** — building integrations with the Model Context Protocol
- **AI-assisted coding** — using Claude Code, Copilot, and similar tools as core parts of production workflows
- **What actually ships** — separating signal from noise

The posts will be practical and honest. When something doesn't work, I'll write about that too.

*In the spirit of eating my own dogfood: an agent helped me structure these thoughts and publish this blog. It set up Jekyll, wrote the CSS, and pushed to GitHub while I told it what I actually wanted to say. Seems fitting.*
