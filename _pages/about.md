Welcome to my AI Journal. I'm Youcef, and this is where I document my journey through the world of artificial intelligence.

Here you'll find my thoughts, learnings, experiments, and projects as I explore machine learning, deep learning, large language models, and everything AI.

Feel free to reach out if you'd like to connect.
