Welcome to my AI Journal. I'm Youcef, and this is where I document my journey building with AI in production.

This isn't about quickly spinning up toy apps. I'm focused on:

- **Agentic AI** — autonomous systems that can reason, plan, and execute
- **MCP servers** — the Model Context Protocol and building real integrations
- **AI-assisted coding in production** — using AI as a serious development tool, not a gimmick

Here you'll find practical insights, hard-won lessons, and honest takes on what works and what doesn't when shipping AI-powered software.

Feel free to reach out if you'd like to connect.
